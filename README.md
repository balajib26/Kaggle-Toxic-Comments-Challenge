# Kaggle-Toxic-Comments-Challenge
This repository contains code to Toxic Comments Challenge held at Kaggle  https://www.kaggle.com/balajib26/competitions .
I trained an ensemble model consisting of Deep Learning algorithms like LSTM, Attention Model, GRU, Glove embedding using Keras and Machine Learning algorithms like Logistic Regression using Scikit-Learn to get an accuracy score of 0.9865 with a leaderboard rank of 280/4551(Top 7%). This repository contains some of the algorithms I implemented with comments.
